# LifeLine App Implementation

A comprehensive task list for implementing the LifeLine mobile application, focusing on security, maintainability, and user experience.

## Task Management Guidelines

### Update Procedures
- Tasks should be updated immediately after completion
- Move completed tasks from "In Progress" to "Completed Tasks" section
- Add new tasks as they are discovered during implementation
- Update documentation references when files are modified
- Add status indicators (âœ…) for completed components

### Documentation Tracking
Current documentation in `/docs`:
- `PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document (168 lines)
- `.cursorrules.md` - Development and Security Guidelines (310 lines)

## Completed Tasks

None yet - Project initialization phase

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Initial project setup
  - [ ] Create React Native project with Expo
  - [ ] Set up TypeScript configuration
  - [ ] Configure ESLint and Prettier
  - [ ] Set up project folder structure

## Future Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security Setup

#### Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Set up Supabase project
- [ ] Configure environment variables management
- [ ] Implement secure secrets handling
- [ ] Set up development, staging, and production environments

----------------------------
Do not do this tasks
#### Authentication & Security
- [ ] Implement secure local storage mechanism
- [ ] Set up authentication flow
- [ ] Configure secure HTTP headers
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Set up input validation and sanitization utilities
- [ ] Configure error handling and logging system
-------------------------------

### Phase 2: Core Features

#### Timeline Implementation
- [ ] Create timeline component
  - [ ] Implement horizontal swipeable interface
  - [ ] Add zoom functionality with date granularity
  - [ ] Implement date markers and current date focus
- [ ] Develop birthday input flow
- [ ] Create event management system
  - [ ] Implement event creation interface
  - [ ] Add event display with speech bubbles
  - [ ] Set up local event storage

#### UI/UX Features

- [ ] Create responsive layout components
- [ ] Add loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] Implement accessibility features
  - [ ] Add ARIA labels
  - [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Maintain proper color contrast

### Phase 3: Data Management & Optimization

#### Database Implementation
- [ ] Design and implement database schema
- [ ] Set up secure database queries
- [ ] Implement data validation layer
- [ ] Add database indexing for performance

#### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement caching strategy
- [ ] Add pagination for event loading
- [ ] Optimize rendering performance
- [ ] Implement code splitting

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation

#### Testing
- [ ] Set up testing environment
- [ ] Write unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical flows

#### Documentation
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Write component documentation
- [ ] Add setup instructions
- [ ] Create user guide

## Implementation Plan

### Security First Approach
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Database queries must use parameterized queries
- Authentication must be implemented before any data persistence
- Regular security audits must be performed
- All sensitive data must be properly encrypted

### Development Workflow
1. Start with core infrastructure and security setup
2. Implement basic timeline functionality with local storage
3. Add event management features
4. Implement UI/UX improvements and themes
5. Add optimization and performance improvements
6. Comprehensive testing and documentation

### Technical Decisions
- Use React Native Paper for UI components
- Implement custom hooks for business logic
- Use Context API for state management
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use TypeScript for type safety
