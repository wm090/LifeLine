# LifeLine App Implementation

A comprehensive task list for implementing the LifeLine mobile application, focusing on security, maintainability, and user experience.

## Task Management Guidelines

### Update Procedures
- Tasks should be updated immediately after completion
- Move completed tasks from "In Progress" to "Completed Tasks" section
- Add new tasks as they are discovered during implementation
- Update documentation references when files are modified
- Add status indicators (âœ…) for completed components

### Documentation Tracking
Current documentation in `/docs`:
- `PRD.md` - Product Requirements Document
- `.cursorrules.md` - Development and Security Guidelines

## Implementation Plan

### Core Timeline-Centered Approach
- Timeline component is the central feature of the app
- Date granularity controls should be prominently placed in the UI for easy access
- All features should integrate naturally with the timeline view
- Ensure smooth performance of timeline swiping and zooming

### Security First Approach
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Database queries must use parameterized queries
- All sensitive data must be properly encrypted
- Regular security audits must be performed
- Implement proper rate limiting for API requests
- Use secure transport protocols (HTTPS) for all network communication

### Development Workflow
1. Start with core timeline functionality and infrastructure
2. Add birthday input and timeline generation
3. Implement event management features
4. Add UI/UX improvements and themes
5. Implement performance optimizations
6. Comprehensive testing and documentation

### Technical Decisions
- Use React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement React Native Paper for UI components
- Create custom hooks for business logic
- Use Context API for state management
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Supabase for backend services
