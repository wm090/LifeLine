Good behaviour prompt 1:

Always implement high quality production ready code that performs the requested task, using the requested tools, libraries, external systems, infrastructure etc. Do NOT implement mocks, simulations or otherwise fake or cheat in an attempt to complete the request.

Good behaviour prompt 2:

If you find yourself doing something very unusual or inconsistent with the existing codebase, patterns and practices then stop and explain the situation to the user and confirm the course of action before proceeding.


Security Audit for Fast AI-Built MVPs
I need you to act as a security expert and do a full audit of the codebase. Your goal is to flag high-impact vulnerabilities and help fix them with minimal changes.
Follow this 3-phase approach:
Phase 1: Codebase Scan
Go through the entire repo. Focus especially on:
• Auth flows
• API endpoints
• DB queries
• Env variables and secrets
• User input handling
Flag anything risky with:
• File name and line numbers
• Clear explanations of what’s wrong
• Priority level (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
Phase 2: Risk Analysis + Fix Plan
For every issue:
• Explain what the vulnerability is
• Describe how it can be exploited
• Recommend the smallest fix needed
• Explain how the fix improves security
Avoid overengineering. Focus on practical fixes that make the code safer without breaking anything.
Phase 3: Secure Fixes
• Make minimal changes
• Show a before/after diff
• Verify the fix works and doesn’t introduce anything new
• Flag anything that needs manual testing
Focus Areas to Prioritize:
• Leaked API keys or credentials
• Missing rate limits
• Broken or bypassable auth
• Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
• Missing server-side validation
• Poor error handling that leaks info
• Sensitive data being exposed unnecessarily
Return the final report as a markdown list I can share with my team.
Be precise. Be realistic. Prioritize impact.

## Code structure & organization

- **Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
  - Extract repeated logic into reusable functions
  - Create utility functions for common operations (validation, formatting, etc.)
  - Use shared components for UI patterns that appear multiple times

- **Break down large files**
  - Split files larger than 300-400 lines into smaller modules
  - Separate concerns: data fetching, business logic, UI rendering
  - Create focused components that do one thing well

- **Use logical file organization**
  - Group related files by feature or domain
  - Create separate directories for components, utilities, services, etc.
  - Follow consistent naming conventions across the project

## Security practices

- **Input validation and sanitization**
  - Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides

## Error handling

- **Implement comprehensive error handling**
  - Catch and handle specific error types differently
  - Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
  - Present user-friendly error messages in the UI

- **Handle async operations properly**

  - Handle network failures gracefully
  - Implement loading states for better user experience

## Performance optimization

  - Cache results of costly calculations
  - Use memoization for pure functions
  - Implement pagination for large data sets

- **Prevent memory leaks**
  - Clean up event listeners and subscriptions
  - Cancel pending requests when components unmount
  - Clear intervals and timeouts when no longer needed

- **Optimize rendering**
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
  - Use virtualization for long lists
  - Implement code splitting and lazy loading

## Database best practices

- **Use transactions for related operations**
  - Wrap related database operations in transactions
  - Ensure data consistency across multiple operations
  - Implement proper rollback mechanisms

- **Optimize queries**
  - Create indexes for frequently queried fields
  - Select only the fields you need
  - Use query pagination when fetching large datasets

- **Handle database connections properly**
  - Use connection pools
  - Close connections when operations complete
  - Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

## API design

- **Follow RESTful principles**
  - Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Return consistent response formats
  - Use meaningful HTTP status codes

- **Design clear endpoints**
  - Organize endpoints by resource
  - Version your API
  - Document all endpoints with examples

- **Implement proper error responses**
  - Return structured error objects
  - Include error codes and helpful messages
  - Maintain detailed logs of API errors

## Maintainability

- **Use clear naming**
  - Choose descriptive variable, function, and class names
  - Avoid abbreviations and cryptic naming
  - Use consistent naming patterns throughout the codebase

- **Add documentation**
  - Document complex functions with clear descriptions
  - Explain the "why" not just the "what"
  - Keep documentation up-to-date when code changes

- **Write tests**
  - Cover critical business logic with unit tests
  - Write integration tests for important flows
  - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys

## Frontend specific

- **Implement form validation**
  - Validate input as users type
  - Provide clear error messages
  - Handle form submission errors gracefully

- **Use proper state management**
  - Choose appropriate state management for your app's complexity
  - Avoid prop drilling through many component levels
  - Keep state as close as possible to where it's needed

- **Ensure accessibility**
  - Use semantic HTML elements
  - Add proper ARIA attributes for complex elements
  - Ensure keyboard navigability
  - Maintain sufficient color contrast

## Security vulnerabilities to prevent

- **SQL/NoSQL injection**
  - Never concatenate user input directly into queries
  - Use parameterized queries or ORM methods

- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)**
  - Sanitize user input before displaying it
  - Use frameworks' built-in protection mechanisms

- **Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)**
  - Implement anti-CSRF tokens
  - Validate request origins

- **Broken authentication**
  - Implement proper session management
  - Use secure password hashing
  - Enforce strong password policies

# Task List Management

Guidelines for creating and managing task lists in markdown files to track project progress

## Task List Creation

1. Create task lists in a markdown file (in the project root):
   - Use `TASKS.md` or a descriptive name relevant to the feature (e.g., `ASSISTANT_CHAT.md`)
   - Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented

2. Structure the file with these sections:
   ```markdown
   # Feature Name Implementation
   
   Brief description of the feature and its purpose.
   
   ## Completed Tasks
   
   - [x] Task 1 that has been completed
   - [x] Task 2 that has been completed
   
   ## In Progress Tasks
   
   - [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
   - [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon
   
   ## Future Tasks
   
   - [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
   - [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation
   
   ## Implementation Plan
   
   Detailed description of how the feature will be implemented.
   
   ### Relevant Files
   
   - path/to/file1.ts - Description of purpose
   - path/to/file2.ts - Description of purpose
   ```

## Task List Maintenance

1. Update the task list as you progress:
   - Mark tasks as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Add new tasks as they are identified
   - Move tasks between sections as appropriate

2. Keep "Relevant Files" section updated with:
   - File paths that have been created or modified
   - Brief descriptions of each file's purpose
   - Status indicators (e.g., ✅) for completed components

3. Add implementation details:
   - Architecture decisions
   - Data flow descriptions
   - Technical components needed
   - Environment configuration

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI should:

1. Regularly update the task list file after implementing significant components
2. Mark completed tasks with [x] when finished
3. Add new tasks discovered during implementation
4. Maintain the "Relevant Files" section with accurate file paths and descriptions
5. Document implementation details, especially for complex features
6. When implementing tasks one by one, first check which task to implement next
7. After implementing a task, update the file to reflect progress

## Example Task Update

When updating a task from "In Progress" to "Completed":

```markdown
## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Implement database schema
- [ ] Create API endpoints for data access

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure environment variables
```

Should become:

```markdown
## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Create API endpoints for data access

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Implement database schema
```
